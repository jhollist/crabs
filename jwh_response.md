- **Comment:** Figure 6. Please use different symbol shapes (circle, triangle..) for different groups of data. Some readers do not have access to color printers or are color-blind.
    - *response:* Figure 6 now has triangles and dots for the separate groups

**Comment:** For the correlation study shown in Fig 4, data were pooled across all four marshes to make comparisons between the four habitats and crab indicators (of population size). Yet, the 2-way ANOVA results shown in Table 2 indicate significant differences and interactions for all three crab species with location (i.e., marsh) and habitat. Is pooling justified? More specifically, my question is this: Would the trends in correlations shown in Figure 2 be the same if the data were not pooled and instead analyses done on a marsh by marsh basis and then compared? The results would be more robust. Also, did the pooled data meet the assumptions of the Pearson correlation test? Some heavy data transformation was needed to pass the assumptions of ANOVA. Nothing is mentioned for Pearson. <!-- JEFF – this might be for both of us – me interpreting the results in terms of if they would change by not pooling, you thinking about this question in general and answering his assumption Q at end…-->
    - *response:* Sample sizes unpooled?  Look at Spearman and distribution of data for assumptions, Look at correlations per Marsh much difference?

**Comment:** l. l. 302-309, Fig. 3. There is a considerable amount of variability displayed in the one-way mean values presented in Fig. 3. What do the error bars represent? The ANOVA indicates that there is a significant difference in burrow density and crab CPUE’s among marshes, and that the difference among marshes depends on the habitat type (or, the difference among habitat types varies across marshes). Thus, it’s not that meaningful to interpret the one way means (i.e., among marshes and among habitats.) I suggest using multiple comparisons to determine significant differences among the 2-way means.  <!-- JEFF – JEFF – can you field this one?  He is asking for the stuff I originally had in the first draft, and then removed when we revised.  Again, I love what you recommended so would like to keep it as is, but to do so would need some nice text to explain this comment away.   -->

** Comment:** l. 313+, Fig. 4. Given that both significant and non-significant correlation results are reported, I would find it useful to know which of the correlations included in Fig. 4 are significant. In addition, it would be useful to know the actual values (ranges, medians, means – whatever makes most sense) for the most important parameters that show different influences depending on habitat type. E.g. burrow density was negatively correlated with soil bulk density in creekbank habitats, and positively correlated with soil bulk density in upper marsh habitats: thus are burrows concentrated in soils of intermediate bulk density, which are at the top of the bulk density range in one habitat type and the bottom of the range in the other habitat type? To me, a table of the actual values of environmental parameters across habitat types, as opposed to strictly relative relationships to response variables, would assist interpretation. <!-- JEFF – same here.  They are asking for what I had originally (the table with #s and p values) but we removed for your correlation bubble figure.  Am lazy and also like what you did, so would like to keep but need you to explain this issue away!-->

**Comment:** l. 345-346, Fig. 6B. I don’t quite understand the analysis and presentation of results for change in bare creekbank over time. COG: the figure suggests that the first data point is 2012 – if this is correct, the regression line should not begin at 2010. Or, if there is a zero data point for 2010, this should be clarified. NAG: a linear model from 2010 to 2015 does not provide the best fit to the data. Why not begin the regression at the zero point in 2012, which is the same analysis done for COG? Interestingly it seems the slope at NAG would then mirror that at COG. <!-- JEFF – the first data point for both marshes is 2010.  I can clarify that in the text, but is there also away to make that 2010 dot not just blue but also red – show two 2010 dots somehow?? -->
    - *response:* Change made in response to Editor comment on Figure 6 shows multiple points at zero now.  Include text in caption to indicate that both nagg and cogg had 0 bcb in 2010.  Also added some transparency to points to hopefully show mulitple points.
