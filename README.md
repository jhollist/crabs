1. R/data_prep.R - prepares data for subsequest analysis
2. R/crab_calc_correlation - calculates correlation, p-values and sample size per correlation.
3. R/corr_fig.R - Creates four panel correlation matrix
4. R/habitat_marsh_compare_fig.R - creates bar plots comparing acorss habitat types and marshes.
